## Generation vape: factors associated with teen e-cigarette use

- Modeled data from the 2020 National Youth Tobacco Survey to classify teens as having used nicotine-containing electronic cigarettes or not  
- Utilized logistic regression, KNN, Random Forest, and XGBoost to explore the most optimal model  
- Applied bootstrapped logistic regression coefficients to determine which survey factors are most associated with e-cigarette use 
  - Survey factors include use of other tobacco products, belief systemms, and exposure to pro- and anti-tobacco influences
